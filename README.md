# ImageInsight-
Major Project B.Tech Repo

The purpose of this research project is to implement a state-of-the art solution for visual learning and visual aid.Implement various steps and algorithms needed to develop a robust and precise image recognition, analysis and description system. The application/domain of this system is inherent in development of various visual aid/learning system and many other domains.

Limitations
Huge data domain to address ranging from simple objects to complex scenes involving mutiple objects.
Complex neural network and nodes tranining takes time to compute.
Outliers in form shape/colour/texture or any other disruptions of objects can lead to false results.

Assumptions
Data has been pre-processed and outliers removed.
Defects/disruptions are negligible in real-world scenario.
The single language used in speech format is understandable universally.
